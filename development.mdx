## Custom ports

By default, Mintlify uses port 3000. You can customize the port Mintlify runs on by using the `--port` flag. For example, to run Mintlify on port 3333, use this command:

```bash
mint dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run Mintlify on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Mintlify versions

Please note that each CLI release is associated with a specific version of Mintlify. If your local preview does not align with the production version, please update the CLI:

```bash
npm mint update
```

## Validating links

The CLI can assist with validating links in your documentation. To identify any broken links, use the following command:

```bash
mint broken-links
```

## Deployment

If the deployment is successful, you should see the following:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/checks-passed.png"
    alt="Screenshot of a deployment confirmation message that says All checks have passed."
    style={{ borderRadius:"0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

## Code formatting

We suggest using extensions on your IDE to recognize and format MDX. If you're a VSCode user, consider the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.
